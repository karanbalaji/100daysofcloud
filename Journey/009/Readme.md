## Prerequisite

This is a follow along workshop and reqires sound AWS knowledge with at least cloud practioner.

## Personalization
AWS translate has list of languages to be used for personalization. I have included some top commonly spoken languges in CanadaðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and hope to see if i could target this part of the project based on Geo location using cloud front or a lambda edge.
