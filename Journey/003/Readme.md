## Introduction

A beginner level project that explaings how to deploy a basic react full stack stack auth app from Github with Amplify.  

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with the AWS portal, IAM, Github.

## Cloud Research

- A treat for Front-end developers because AWS Amplify is the fastest way to build and deploy web and mobile apps. It has lot of tools and open source use case centric libraries that can be used to quickly implement features.

## Try yourself

### Step 1 — Scroll down and select the deploy to amplify console.
#### Link to the Repo https://github.com/karanbalaji/gatsby-auth-starter-aws-amplify

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I found that Setting up Webapp on AWS amplify was much faster and easier than Azure because of its starter templates available on gatsby. Creating role and a policy is the only extra step to creating #AWSome full stack app. 

## Next Steps

I would add more features and implement more AWS related things to this full stack app.
