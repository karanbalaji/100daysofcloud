## Introduction

A beginner level project with azure that helped me get used to its User Interface(Has Dark Mode) which is great compared to AWS. I choosed to do this because it helped me understand the basics of static web hosting.

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with the Azure Portal

## Cloud Research

- I like that Azure and Github goes well together than AWS. Lot of beginner users are already familiar with Github than AWS CodeCommit. On Github We can also immediatly template a project or fork it quickly. This seemed to be very useful when it comes to building quick landing pages on Azure than AWS.

## Try yourself

### Step 1 — Create a GitHub account and click the "Use This Template" button.
